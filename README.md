# Home Exchange Platform (HomeShare)

## The Scenario

A hypothetical client asked us to develop a web application that would enable private home owners to connect with each other for the purpose of exchanging their homes during the holidays, a weekend or all year long. This application would have to facilitate the search and exchange of homes throughout Europe.
Each owner will have to register themselves in order to upload their home to the catalogue or rent a home through the platform. All this to guarantee the following of active accounts and their transactions.

All exchanges done via the app are billed 5 EUR/exchange and the personal information of the owners involved in the transaction is only available to the other party after the payment of this fee. This fee only covers administrative costs and doesn't take into account any additional insurance taken by the "exchanger". This insurance is optional upon validation of an order and is of 10 EUR/day.

The application will also have to allow the modification of a user's information and home information anytime.

## The Exam

Our teacher tasked us for the 4 days of this examination to design and implement a database and a back-end for the application described above. The purpose was to test our logic and programming ability server-side however we were also given the additional task to design the remaining pages on the front-end for the features we would have to implement on the back-end following the homepage template provided by our teacher.

**Current state of the project**: I have implemented the code necessary to display the information in the database that I created. The project is however missing proper authentication and registration and I also haven't implemented the forms necessary for the order yet. A lot of my time during that period back in February 2022 was spent designing the database and the software while making sure all the layers communicated properly.

## Technologies

This web application was built entirely using ASP.NET Core and its Razor page generator. It was also programmed to work with a Microsoft SQL Server database via ADO.NET.
